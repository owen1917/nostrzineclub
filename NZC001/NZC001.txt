Why we NEED Value for Value Music Streaming

Traditional streaming services like Spotify and Apple Music often pay musicians very little, leaving them with pathetic profits despite their hard work.

With Value for Value streaming, musicians can bypass the GREEDY middlemen and receive direct payments from their fans.

What is "Value for Value"?

“Value for Value is a monetization model, a content format, and a way of life.”

It’s a new approach that benefits both musicians and fans. It empowers musicians by allowing them to be directly paid by their fans for digital content, instead of being RIPPED OFF by big companies.

Fans can show their appreciation by sending tiny Bitcoin payments as they listen to music, fostering a sense of support and community.

The Role of Bitcoin (and Lightning⚡️) in Value for Value

Bitcoin is more punk than punk. Bitcoin is decentralized, censorship resistant money, controlled by the people.

The Lightning Network is a second layer built on top of Bitcoin. It boasts almost zero fees for transactions, and it’s borderless.

Lightning is ideal for sending global micro payments (know as “Boosts”) to musicians - without the red-tape and high fees introduced by traditional payment networks.

By using Bitcoin, you’re not just giving the middle finger to greedy streaming platforms...

you’re saying FUCK YOU to corrupt banks and nosey governments too.
